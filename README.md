# Stop Procrastinating

An **empathetic, behavior-focused anti-procrastination assistant** designed to help students overcome inertia, start tasks early, and improve consistency through awareness, reflection, and gentle recommendations.

This project focuses on **reducing procrastination**, not forcing productivity.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students (especially aged 18–24) often procrastinate due to:
- low energy
- boredom
- fear of difficulty
- digital distractions
- lack of daily reflection

Most productivity tools focus on *planning more*, while the real issue is **not starting**.

**Stop Procrastinating** is built to address this behavioral gap.
